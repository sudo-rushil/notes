\begin{theorem}
Describe the representations $V_1$ and $V_2$, and express them as direct sums of irreducible representations of $S_4$. Which degree 2 polynomials $f(x,y,z)$ are invariant under $S_4$?
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Note that we may take the following as the rotation matrices of representative elements of conjugacy classes in $S_4$ acting on $\R^3$:

\[
	\boxed{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n z^n}
.\] 
\end{proof}

Describe the representations $V_1$ and $V_2$, and express them as direct sums of irreducible representations of $S_4$. Which degree 2 polynomials $f(x,y,z)$ are invariant under $S_4$?
